# direnvsh
Load environment variables from files in parent directories into shell and run programs.

## Usage

1. Download the file [direnvsh](./direnvsh).
2. Create one or more files in the current or parent directories called `.envrc` containing KEY=VALUE pairs.
3. Run `direnvsh`, by either loading into your shell session (`. ./direnvsh`), or make it executable (`chmod 755 direnvsh`) and execute it (`./direnvsh`).

At the end of loading the envrc files, if you have supplied any commands and arguments after the `direnvsh` options, execution will pass to that command with the environment variables set. Add `--` after any `direnvsh` options to prevent confusion with command arguments.

If a file `.stopdirenvshrc` exists in a current or parent directory or the `DIRENVSH_STOP` variable is set to `1`, all parsing will stop.

## Modes

There are 3 different execution modes for `direnvsh`:

1. **Simple mode (default):** Parse files with `KEY=VALUE` entries on each new line. These are not interpreted by a shell script, they are literals only (do not enclose the value with quote symbols unless you want those quotes to stay in the value). Any environment variables (`$FOO`, `${FOO}`) are automatically interpolated. Lines starting with '#' are ignored. 

2. **Dynamic mode:** Each file is assumed to be a shell script and is sourced into the current shell session immediately. Keep in mind all the syntax of normal shell scripts, like quoting values with spaces. This will also execute any commands in the file, so be very careful with this mode.

3. **Export mode:** Like **Dynamic mode**, except each file is loaded in a separate subshell, its values 'export'ed, and all 'export' variables are loaded into the current shell at the end. This makes it less likely that a badly-formatted file can crash your current shell session, but it will use temporary files and more resources and be slower.

| Name | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEBUG` | 0 | If '1', enables trace mode in the shell |
| `DIRENVSH_EXPORT_MODE` | 0 | If set to '1', enable Export mode. |
| `DIRENVSH_SIMPLE_MODE` | 0 | If set to '1', enable Simple mode. |
| `DIRENVSH_DYNAMIC_MODE` | 0 | If set to '1', enable Dynamic mode. |
| `DIRENVSH_STOP` | 0 | If set to'1', stop processing any more envrc files. |
| `ENVRC` | .envrc | The name of the file(s) to load variables from. |
| `TMPDIR` | /tmp | The directory in which to create temporary files if you use Export mode. |
