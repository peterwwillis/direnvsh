# direnvsh
direnvsh makes it easy to load (and override) environment variables in your shell, using default files in parent/child directories, and then optionally run programs.

## Requirements
- A POSIX shell

## Usage

1. Download the file [direnvsh](./direnvsh).
2. Create one or more files in current, parent, or child directories containing KEY=VALUE pairs.
3. Run `direnvsh`, by either loading into your shell session (`. ./direnvsh`), or make it executable (`chmod 755 direnvsh`) and execute it (`./direnvsh`).

At the end of loading env files, if you have supplied any commands and arguments after the `direnvsh` options, execution will pass to that command with the environment variables set. Add `--` after any `direnvsh` options to prevent confusion with command arguments.

If a file `.stopdirenvsh` exists in a current or parent directory or the `DIRENVSH_STOP` variable is set to `1`, all parsing will stop.

## Example

```
$ cd git/direnv/test/simple-mode/1/2/3/
$ echo 'THIS=THAT $BAR VAR' > .env
$ echo 'BAR=BAZ thing $FOO' > ../.env
$ echo 'FOO=BAR' > ../../.env
$ ../../../../../direnvsh sh -c 'echo $THIS'
../../../../../direnvsh: Found '/home/user/git/direnvsh/test/.stopdirenvsh', ending processing
../../../../../direnvsh: Loading envrc '/home/user/git/direnvsh/test/simple-mode/1/.env'
../../../../../direnvsh: Loading envrc '/home/user/git/direnvsh/test/simple-mode/1/2/.env'
../../../../../direnvsh: Loading envrc '/home/user/git/direnvsh/test/simple-mode/1/2/3/.env'
THAT BAZ thing BAR VAR
```

## Modes

There are 3 different execution modes for `direnvsh`:

### 1. Simple mode

Default mode. Looks for files called `.env`. Parses files with `KEY=VALUE` entries on each new line. These lines must be literals, e.g. **they are not treated like a shell script** (do not enclose the value with quote symbols unless you want those quotes to stay in the value). Any environment variables (`$FOO`, `${FOO}`) are automatically interpolated. Lines starting with '#' are ignored. 

### 2. Immediate mode

Looks for files called `.envrc`. **These files are assumed to be shell scripts**; you can make them `KEY="VALUE"` lines, or do crazier stuff. Each file is sourced into the current shell session immediately. Keep in mind all the syntax of normal shell scripts, e.g. escaping special characters. Since this is just loading a shell script, you can put shell code in there too.

### 3. Export mode

Like **Immediate mode**, except each file is loaded in a separate subshell, its values 'export'ed, and all 'export' variables are loaded into the current shell session at the end. This makes it less likely that a badly-formatted file can crash your current shell session, but it will use temporary files and more resources and be slower.

**NOTE:** **Export mode** doesn't interpolate variables between files. Interpolation only works for variables within each file, and with variables that were passed to `direnvsh` from the parent process environment.


## File Search Direction

The direction (`-D`) option determines whether the script looks 'backward' (in parent directories) or 'forward' (in child directories) for env files.


## Env Processing Precedence

The precedence (`-P`) option determines whether the parent directory's files are processed before the current directory's files, or vice versa. If the order is 'far', parent directory files are processed first. If the order is 'close', the reverse happens.

If you don't specify the precedence, it defaults to 'far' if the *Direction* was 'backward', and it defaults to 'close' if the *Direction* was 'forward'. This allows files deeper in a filesystem hierarchy to override.


## Environment Variables

| Name | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEBUG` | 0 | If '1', enables trace mode in the shell |
| `DIRENVSH_EXPORT_MODE` | 0 | If set to '1', enable Export mode. |
| `DIRENVSH_SIMPLE_MODE` | 0 | If set to '1', enable Simple mode. |
| `DIRENVSH_IMMEDIATE_MODE` | 0 | If set to '1', enable Immediate mode. |
| `DIRENVSH_PRECEDENCE` | far | If set to 'far', loads parent files first. If set to 'close', loads closer files first. |
| `DIRENVSH_DIRECTION` | backward | If set to 'backward', loads files from parent directories. If set to 'forward', loads files from child directories. |
| `DIRENVSH_STOP` | 0 | If set to'1', stop processing any more envrc files. |
| `ENVRC` | .envrc | The name of the file(s) to load variables from. |
| `TMPDIR` | /tmp | The directory in which to create temporary files if you use Export mode. |
| `direnvsh_cwd` | *envrc directory* | During envrc processing, the name of the directory the file is in. |
| `direnvsh_level` | 0 | During envrc processing, the level of the parent directory of the file. |
