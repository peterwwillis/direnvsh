# direnvsh
Load environment variables from files in parent directories into shell and run programs.

## Usage

1. Download the file [direnvsh](./direnvsh).
2. Create one or more files in the current or parent directories called `.envrc`. It should be a shell script which sets environment variables.
3. Run `direnvsh`, by either loading into your shell session (`. ./direnvsh`) or make it executable (`chmod 755 direnvsh`) and execute it (`./direnvsh`).

`direnvsh` accepts some options and arbitrary commands & arguments. You should separate the two with the `--` argument if you don't want `direnvsh` to get confused.

If you pass commands & arguments to `direnvsh`, they will be executed with `exec`. All execution will pass to that command, and `direnvsh` will exit when the passed command exits. Your current shell session will end if you pass commands when loading into your current session (e.g. `. ./direnvsh ls` will make your shell exit once `ls` finishes running)
